# Finding Donors for CharityML

Construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50000 per year.

## Results:

The Gradient Boosting Classifier shows the best score (accuracy score of 0.87) in predicting individuals that make more than $50000 per year.

## Strategy:

Create a pipeline, implementation and tunning of the best classifier (F-score, acccurary, time) between Random Forest, AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting over a 13-features dataset of data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census ([UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income)).
